# peer-net

## a p2p link sharing app;

## premise:
information spreads based on how sticky it is.
the feed you have is based on your random peer network.
each peer sorts links into keep and discard.
each peer can search through other peer's keep and discard pile.
the more peers that have the same link: the higher it rises in your feed.
ephemeral, without comments, or users, just links)
